conquer-the-spire is Slay the Spire simulator using C++ with some reinforcement learning. The code is built on C++17 and can be compiled with commonly available compilers such as g++, clang++, or Microsoft Visual Studio. conquer-the-spire currently supports macOS (10.14 or later), Ubuntu (18.04 or later), Windows (Visual Studio 2017 or later), and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Other untested platforms that support C++17 also should be able to build conquer-the-spire.

## Quick Start

You will need CMake to build the code. If you're using Windows, you need Visual Studio 2017 in addition to CMake.

First, clone the code:

```
git clone https://github.com/utilForever/conquer-the-spire.git --recursive
cd conquer-the-spire
```

### C++ API

For macOS or Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

For Windows:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
MSBuild conquer-the-spire.sln /p:Configuration=Release
```

### Docker

```
docker pull utilforever/conquer-the-spire:latest
```
